#SimuFerro

##Introduction
SimuFerro is a tool that allows you to load a 
[Google Transit Feed Specification](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference)
file and view it into a canvas.

##Prerequisite
In order to execute this tool, you will need to install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/).

Then, after cloning this repository, you will have to run `npm install` and `bower install` commands into the root folder.
When all is ready, run the `grunt server` command to launch the tool.

This tool needs a [modern browser](http://browsehappy.com/) (supporting the canvas element).
